# Restaurant Reviews Application
 ===============================

A Udacity Front-End Developer Scholarship Project - 2018


For the Restaurant Reviews projects, I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage One, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also begun converting this to a Progressive Web Application by caching some assets for offline use.


I was provided code for a restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. My job was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

## Running the Feed
If you want to load the page locally, you should first clone the repository and open index.html via a local server.
Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
